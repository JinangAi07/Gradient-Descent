Title: Solving Univariate Linear Regression and Multivariate Linear Regression with Gradient Descent
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Jinang.Ai
Maintainer: Jinang.Ai <Jinang.Ai@campus.lmu.de>
Description: This package includes two functions to implement linear regression using gradient descent for both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional data. The GD_one_dim function adjusts weight and bias to fit a linear model to a single variable, while GD_multi_dim handles multiple variables using matrix operations. Both provide visualizations of the loss and predictions, making them useful for analyzing model performance and convergence.
